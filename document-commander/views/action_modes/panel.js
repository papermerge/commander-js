        * single
        * dual

    When only one panel is active (i.e. the view is now in single mode)
    this view will render as a button with "dual-panel" icon - thus
    suggesting to user that when clicked it will go into dual mode.

    When two panels are active (i.e. the view is in dual mode)
    current/this view will render as a button with a cross (i.e. "close me" icon)
    thus implying to user that when clicked current panel will close leving
    user with only one panel open (single panel mode).
